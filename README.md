Croogo16 - Base Template for Croogo V1.6
============

A Simple/basic template for developing [Croogo v1.6](http://www.croogo.org) themes using [zurb-foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

- using sass foundation
- basic css & js structure
- basic default layout

To make this template work using Compass extension, you'll need to have the zurb-foundation gem installed. This will install Foundation and all necessary dependencies. Here's the command that will do after you clone the template:

run this under `webroot/` folder
<pre>
[sudo] compass install foundation
</pre>

Inside this template, I have create some example element. either you can remove it or modified for your project.

feel free to modified all the elements, css, js inside this template.

hope this template can help make all the basic stuff created faster and get on with your own custom styling a.s.a.p!


Cheers,
